🤖 CrewAI Model Validation System
---------------------------------
Multi-agent validation for clinical evidence, statistical performance, and bias assessment.

# Agents & Their Roles:
# 1. Clinical Evidence Specialist
#    - Tool: ModelValidationTool
#    - Task: Validate AI model predictions against clinical evidence, guidelines, and research literature.

# 2. Statistical Performance Expert
#    - Tool: ModelValidationTool
#    - Task: Evaluate statistical performance (AUROC, AUPRC, Sensitivity, Specificity, Calibration, etc.) and check against clinical utility thresholds.

# 3. Bias & Fairness Auditor
#    - Tool: ModelValidationTool
#    - Task: Assess fairness across demographics (age, gender, ethnicity),
#             check parity metrics, and recommend bias mitigation strategies.

# 4. Integration Specialist
#    - Tool: None (uses only LLM)
#    - Task: Integrate findings from all validators, generate deployment recommendations,
#             and provide actionable guidance for clinical adoption.

# Tool Used:
# - ModelValidationTool (single tool shared across agents, except Integration Specialist).

# Tasks Defined:
# - Clinical Evidence Validation Task
# - Statistical Performance Validation Task
# - Bias & Fairness Analysis Task
# - Integration & Deployment Recommendation Task
